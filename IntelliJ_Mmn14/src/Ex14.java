    /**
     * This method takes an appropriate array of integers,
     * which each number occurs twice in a row but only 1 number which occurs only once ("orphan"),
     * and returns that one number (not it's index!)
     * The runtime complexity of the method is big O of log base 2 of N => O(logN), because we are using a binary search algorithm
     * The space complexity is, of course, O(1)
     * @param a An appropriate array of integers.
     * @return The "orphan" number which occurs only once in the array provided (not it's index!).
