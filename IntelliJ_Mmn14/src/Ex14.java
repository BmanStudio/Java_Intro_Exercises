     *  because we are "inspecting" the middle element in the array, and each time "narrowing" the array by half, and repeating the process until we found the single number
     *  or we got to a 1 element's array.
     * Space complexity
     *  O(1) - because we are just storing 3 integers variables.

     * Time complexity:
     *  O(N) - there is one iteration over all the elements of the array, which is O(N).
     *      Within the for loop we are "adding" elements to a temporary subarray which is
     *      being checked every time (after the element is being added).
     *      once we found a subarray which sums to more than the given number - we will
     *      enter a while loop, but LETS PAY ATTENTION - within the while loop we are "removing" elements from the temporary subarray.
     *      So - the maximum iterations of the inner while loop is the size of the subarray, which can only get as big as N (which will happen ONLY on the last iteration).
     *      Because the while loop removes elements from the subarray, there cannot be more than 1 subarray with a size of N.
     *      We conclude that, for the worst case, the inner "while loop" will run A TOTAL of N times during the whole "for loop" iteration
     *      (because IN THE WORST CASE there is only N elements we can add in total, means we have N elements to remove in total)
